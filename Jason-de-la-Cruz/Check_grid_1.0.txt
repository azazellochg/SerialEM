# INSTRUCTIONS: Modify settings in section below.  Set "setIntensityCmd" to
#               either "SetIlluminatedArea" for FEI Titan series or 
#               "SetPercentC2" for all other microscopes.  Decide on condenser
#               beam illumination (aperture, spot size); enter desired spot
#               size below.  Then set "lowMag" to lowest mag with unobstructed
#               view of TEM grid (i.e., the mag you use for whole-grid atlas),
#               adjust intensity for optimum signal, center beam shift, then
#               record intensity value in "lowMagIntensity".
#               When ready to start, open file to save autodoc metadata (with
#               .mdoc or .idoc) then run the script.  Close the file when done.

# Please check that beam is centered in low mag before continuing.
# Ensure all checkboxes in "Script > Controls..." dialog are unchecked to avoid
# "low counts" errors.
