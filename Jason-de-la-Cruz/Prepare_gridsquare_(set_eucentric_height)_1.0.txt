# INSTRUCTIONS: Modify settings in section below.  Set "setIntensityCmd" to
#               either "SetIlluminatedArea" for FEI Titan series or 
#               "SetPercentC2" for all other microscopes.  Decide on condenser
#               beam illumination (aperture, spot size); enter desired spot
#               size below.  Then set "highMag" to a mag that maximizes area
#               of single gridsquare on detector.  Adjust intensity for
#               optimum signal, center beam shift, then record intensity value
#               in "highMagIntensity".
#               Then drop the mag to lowest mag with unobstructed view of TEM
#               grid (i.e., the mag you use for whole-grid atlas), center beam
#               shift, adjust intensity, and enter appropriate values in
#               "lowMag" and "lowMagIntensity".
#               Open Navigator and collect whole-grid atlas.  Add a point at
#               the center of each gridsquare you wish to set at eucentric
#               height.
#               If necessary, go to each XY coordinate to center the point in
#               "highMag" using the Navigator "Move Item" button.  For those
#               points you want to run the script on, set to "Acquire".
#               When ready to start, open file to save autodoc metadata (with
#               .mdoc or .idoc).  Run the script using the SerialEM menu option
#               "Navigator > Acquire at Points".  Close the file when done.

# Please check that beam is centered in both low and high mags before
# continuing.
# Ensure all checkboxes in "Script > Controls..." dialog are unchecked to avoid
# "low counts" errors.
