    # only for every 10th movie (DisplayOnly=10) or even more rarely:

    # Define, how often the microscope should focus: 
    # focusEachHole := 0   means to keep focus target constant and focus always.
    # focusEachHole := 1   means to increment focus target and focus always.
    # focusEachHole := 5   means to increment focus target and focus only every 5th image.
