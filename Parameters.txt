## for LD-Modulo 
# 1) type to do 
# type = 0 -> Precisely to the picked point
# type = 1 -> Use ZeroIS-quick, i.e. rough positioning
# type = 2 -> Align to template in P twice, precisely
# type = 3 -> Align to template once, rough positioning
type = 3

# 2) points to do things. Skip between those points.
# E.g. pointXY = 7, pointZ = 14, do XY at 7th, and Z at 14th
# E.g. pointZ = 0 -> not do Z change at all
# E.g. pointXY = pointZ = 1, do everything at everything point
#      i.e. not to skip any point. 
pointXY = 1
pointZ = 1

## for CycleTargetDefocus (um), default step is 0.1(um)
TD_low = -1.2
TD_high = -2.2

## for Drift 
# skip = 1 -> no drift control
# skip = 0 -> drift control
# drift rate threshold (A/sec.), only get used for skip = 0
skip = 1
crit = 5

## K2 special, is this a K2 camera. 1 for yes, 0 for no.
# this is for no return for Record Frame exposure for a K2 camera.
# how many first frames to return sum, only get used for k2 = 1
k2 = 0
no_return = 0

## for movie collection on K2 or Falcon Hack, return sum to SEM might 
## not need to be saved. Set "save" to 1 to save or 0 not to save.
save = 1
